# Project Euler Solutions
This repository contains my solutions to various [Project Euler](projecteuler.net) problems, implemented in Rust. It serves as a personal learning project to explore and enhance my Rust programming skills.
## How to use this Repository
1. **Choose a Problem:** Browse the list of solved problems and select one that interests you.
2. **Review the solution:** Check out the Rust source file within the problem's directory for the implementation details. Each file has a link to the problem.
3. **Get inspired:** Some solutions are creative, some are smart, and some do what computers can do best - Crunch the numbers, aka bruteforce. All solutions fit into the "one-minute-rule" of Project Euler, where each problem can be solved in less than a minute of computation, given the correct algorithm.
4. **Compile and Run:** Run `cargo run [--release]` in the problem's directory to build and run the source file.
## Why Rust?
The primary motivation behind this repository is to learn and become proficient in the Rust programming language. By solving Project Euler problems in Rust, I can practice the language's features, explore its standard library, and deepen my understanding of Rust's ownership model and functional programming concepts.
